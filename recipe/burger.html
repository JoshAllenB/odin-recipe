    <h2>Smash Burger</h2>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy 
        edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best 
        results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to 
        cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. 
        These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make 
        sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean cut)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the 
        grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron 
        skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the 
        flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack
        the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.
        Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment
        (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on 
        second patty)and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness 
        using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper 
        leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet.
        Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the
        centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm
        spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately
        cover 4 of them with cheese.  Gri an additional 15 to 20 seconds;
        stack the pain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have
        4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
